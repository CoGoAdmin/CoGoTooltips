1^<p>Code on the Go is an integrated development environment (IDE) to build Android apps that runs on Android phones and doesn't need a connection to the Internet.</p>^<p>If you already know how to code using Java or Kotlin, Code on the Go lets  you develop and compile Android apps without requiring you to go online.  Our goal is to make computer science education and programming resources globally available.</p>^1^Learn more about Code on the Go^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/getstarted_top.html^^^^
100^<p>Create a new empty project or use a template.</p>^<p>When you start a new project, Code on the Go creates the right structure for your files. To get started quickly, you can begin a new project using a template that contains starter code and features for a specific kind of app.</p>^2^Learn more about projects^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/projects_top.html^Learn more about templates^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/templates_top.html^^
110^<p>Open a saved project.</p>^<p>To open an existing project, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Tap <b>Open an existing project</b>. A list of folders and projects on your device will be displayed. <li>Navigate to the location of the project you want to open. <li>Tap the project name. Code on the Go will open the project. This may take a few minutes. <li>When <b>Project initialized</b> is displayed at the bottom of the screen, you can begin work on the saved project.</ol>^1^Learn more about projects^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/projects_top.html^^^^

import^<p><code>import</code> declares a Java class to use in the code below the import statement.</p>^<p>After a Java class is declared, the class name can be used in the code without specifying the package that the class belongs to.</p>^1^Learn more about import and other Java keywords^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/Java_keywords.html#import^^^^
class^<p>A <code>class</code> definition contains its objects’ data and behavior. A defined class acts as a template to create individual objects or instances of the class.</p>^<p>A class definition contains variables that store the object’s information and methods that process the information.</p>^1^Learn more about class and other Java keywords^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/Java_keywords.html#class^^^^
extend^<p>Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass or in an interface declaration to specify one or more superinterfaces.</p>^<p>Class X extends class Y to add functionality by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by overriding methods of class Y.</p>
</p>When used in an interface declaration, an interface Z extends one or more interfaces by adding methods. Z is said to be a subinterface of the interfaces it extends.</p>
<p>Also used to specify an upper bound on a type parameter in Generics.</p>^1^Learn more about extend and other Java keywords^file:///android_asset/idetooltips/Java_keywords.html#extend^^^^
