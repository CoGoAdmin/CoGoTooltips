[TLDR]: Please send the download and install code for the Premium Pack + HelpXPlain add-on, which is necessary to support certain customization features needed for online help. 

Hi, Nathan and Karen: 

Hope y'all had a nice Easter! 

When you purchased Help+Manual, did you also purchase the Premium Pack (which includes HelpXPlain) per my request? I've only received an email with the licensing key for the full application. 

According to H+M support (see bottom of message), there should be a separate receipt for it that includes a download link and the installation password. 

Thanks,
Elissa Miller
