<h1>Projects Overview</h1>

<p>A project in Code on the Go contains everything that defines your workspace for an app, including source code and resources to help test and build your app.</p>
<p>Here's a random image because we need to test an image:</p>

<p>When you start a new project, Code on the Go creates the necessary structure for all your files and makes them visible in the Project window. To open the Project window, swipe right on the screen or tap the upper-left menu. </p>

<p>The content on this page is for demo purposes only. It may not make sense to have all the module and library stuff default on the page--there's a good chance that makes more sense when you're actually IN the IDE, not picking a template.</p>

<a name="project_create"><h2>Create a project</h2></a>
<p>To create a project, follow these steps on the <u>Get started</u> page:
</p>    
<ol><li>Tap <b>Create project</b>. The <u>New project</u> page is displayed.
<li>Select a template. Learn more about templates here. A configuration page for the project is displayed. 
<li>In the <u>App name</u> field, enter a name for your app. The <u>Package name</u> field will be updated with the name of the app.
<li>The project will be saved in the default directory. To change the directory, tap <b>Save location</b> and select a different directory.</li>
<li>Tap <b>Create project.</b> Code on the Go will create new project files and directories. Please be patient while Code on the Go sets up the project. When the process is finished, Project Initialized will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
<li>To see the file structure for your app and begin writing code, swipe from the left side of the screen to the right. The file tree for your project will be displayed.
</ol>

<a name="project_opensaved"></a><h2>Open a saved project</h2>
<p>To open a saved project, follow these steps on the <u>Get started</u> page:</p>
<ol><li>Tap <b>Open a saved project</b>. A screen to locate the saved project is displayed.
<li> WRITE MORE WHEN THE PROCESS MAKES SENSE.
</ol>
<a name="project_delete"><h2>Delete a project</h2></a>
<p><b>WARNING</b>: Deleting a project permanently removes all of the files and directories associated with your project. A deleted project can't be restored.</p>  
<p>To delete a project, follow these steps on the <u>Get started</u>page:</p>
<ol><li>Tap <b>Delete a project</b>. SOMETHING WILL BE DISPLAYED.
<li>DO WHATEVER YOU DO TO LOCATE AND SELECT A PROJECT TO DELETE.
<li>CLICK WHAT YOU CLICK. A CONFIRMATION DIALOG SHOULD DEFINITELY BE DISPLAYED. 
<li>CLICK WHAT YOU CLICK TO THE CONFIRM. The project will be deleted and the <u>Get started</p> page will be displayed.
</ol>
<a name="modules_about"><h1>Modules Overview</h1></a>                                                                                              

<p>A module is a collection of source files and build settings that let you divide your project into discrete units of functionality. Your project can have one or many modules, and one module can use another module as a dependency. You can independently build, test, and debug each module.

<p>Additional modules are useful when creating code libraries within your own project or when you want to create different sets of code and resources for different device types, such as phones and wearables, but keep all the files scoped within the same project and share some code. Some common modules are described below.</p>


<table style="font-size: 12px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Module</th>
    <th>Overview</th>
   
  </tr>
<tr><td>Library modules</td>
<td>Library modules provide a container for your reusable code, which you can use as a dependency in other app modules or import into other projects. Structurally, a library module is the same as an app module, but when built, it creates a code archive file instead of an APK, so it can't be installed on a device.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Android app modules</td>
<td>These modules provide containers for your app's source code, resource files, and app-level settings, such as the module-level build file and Android Manifest file. When you create a new project, the default app module is named "app." This may be a link to a help page that's entirely about modules.</td>
</tr>
<table>

<h1>Project files</h1>
<p>By default, Code on the Go displays your project files in the Android view. This view is organized by modules and file types to simplify navigation between key source files of your project and hides some files or directories that are not commonly used.</p>

<p>Files are organized in the following way:</p>

<table style="font-size: 12px;">
  <tr>
    <th>File type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>manifests</td>
    <td>Contains the AndroidManifest.xml file. Learn more about manifests.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>java</td>
    <td>Contains the Kotlin and Java source code files, separated by package names, including JUnit test code.</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>res</td>
    <td>Contains all non-code resources, such as UI strings and bitmap images, divided into corresponding subdirectories. For more information about possible resource types, see App resources overview, a page that doesn't exist yet...but it will.</td>
 </tr>
