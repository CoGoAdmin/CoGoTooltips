<h1>Welcome to Code on the Go</h1>
<p>Code on the Go is a programming environment that can run on Android devices with or without an Internet connection. With Code on the Go, you can build and share new apps anywhere.</p>
<p>This Code on the Go release contains everything you need to build an Android app on your Android device. Both Java and Kotlin are supported.</p>
<p>This release of Code on the Go assumes you have some experience programming in Java or Kotlin. If you're familiar with programing but new to Android development, <a href="lifecycle_top.html">click here to learn the basics about developing for Android</a>.</p>
