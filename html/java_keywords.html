Abstract methods must be implemented in the subclasses. <code>Abstract</code> cannot be used with variables or constructors. Note that an abstract class is not required to have an abstract method.

     <td><code>assert</code> describes a predicate placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that a true/false statement is true and must always be true at that place. <code>Assert</code> describes a predicate (a true-false statement (called a predicate) placed in a Java program that to indicates that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort.

It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the implements keyword. As multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, interfaces are used to circumvent this limitationit.

     <a name="static"><code>static</code></td><td> Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field.  Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. <code>static</code> also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of to a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. Classes and interfaces declared as <code>static</code> members of another class or interface are behaviorally top-level classes.

Used to access members of a class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of its superclass. The <code>super</code> keyword is also used to forward a call from a constructor to a constructor in the superclass. Also used to specify a lower bound on a type parameter in Generics.
 
  </td></tr>

   <tr><td>
     
     <a name="switch"><code>switch</code></td><td>The <code>switch</code> keyword is used in conjunction with <code>case</code> and <code>default</code> to create a switch statement. The switch statement evaluates a variable, matches its value to a specific <code>case</code>, and executes the block of statements associated with that <code>case</code>. If no <code>case</code> matches the value, the optional block labeled by <code>default</code> is executed if it is included. 
 </td></tr>
      
 <tr><td>
     
     <a name="synchronized"><code>synchronized</code></td><td>Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the current thread executes the code. For static methods, the object locked is the class's <code>Class</code>. Guarantees that at most one thread at a time operating on the same object executes that code. The mutex lock is automatically released when execution exits the synchronized code. Fields, classes and interfaces cannot be declared as <code>synchronized</code>.
  </td></tr>     


<tr><td>
     
     <a name="this"><code>this</code></td><td> Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. The keyword <code>this</code> can be used to access class members and as a reference to the current instance. The keyword is also used to forward a call from one construct in a class to another constructor in the same class.  
  </td></tr>

  <tr><td>
     
     <a name="throw"><code>throw</code></td><td> Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the <code>catch</code> keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught exception handler.

  <tr><td>
     
     <a name="throws"><code>throws</code></td><td>Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of <code>RuntimeException</code> must be declared using the <code>throws</code> keyword.
  
  </td></tr>
                            
     <tr><td>
        <a name="transient"><code>transient</code></td><td> Declares that an instance field is not part of the default serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized, only the values of its non-transient instance fields are included in the default serial representation. When an object is deserialized, transient fields are initialized only to their default value. If the default form is not used, e.g. when a <i>serialPersistentFields</i> table is declared in the class hierarchy, all <code>transient</code> keywords are ignored.

     </td></tr>

       <tr><td>
        <a name="try"><code>try</code></td><td>   Defines a block of statements that have exception handling. If an exception is thrown inside the <code>try</code> block, an optional <code>catch</code> block can handle declared exception types. Also, an optional finally block can be declared that will be executed when execution exits the <code>try</code> block and <code>catch</code> clauses, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. A try block must have at least one <code>catch</code> clause or a <code>finally</code> block.
     </td></tr>

     <tr><td>
        <a name="void"><code>void</code></td><td>    Used to declare that a method does not return any value.


     </td></tr>
 
     <tr><td>
        <a name="volatile"><code>volatile</code></td><td>    Used in field declarations to guarantee visibility of changes to variables across threads. Every read of a volatile variable will be read from main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache. Methods, classes and interfaces thus cannot be declared volatile, nor can local variables or parameters.

     </td></tr>
     <tr><td>
        <a name="while"><code>while</code></td><td>    Used to create a while loop, which tests a Boolean expression and executes the block of statements associated with the loop if the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>. This continues until the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>. This keyword can also be used to create a do-while loop,
